## Reactivity and state manipulation explained in Vanilla JS
This is just an example that I prepared for a friend of mine who wanted to know the process of state manipulation on the DOM, and why we do the things that we do nowadays, and whats the deal with all these frameworks and wich issue they are trying to address.

There are a few things that I covered face to face actually, but I hope the code and the comments i left help anyone out there to get a clear understanding on state manipulation and reactivity.
